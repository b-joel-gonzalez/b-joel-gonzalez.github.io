                    <br> I'm a doctoral student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (started Fall 2021). I attended the University of Pennsylvania for my B.S.E. in Computer Science (2019) and my M.S.E. in Robotics (2021). <br>
                        
                    <br> I was born in New York City but I have lived in Pennsylvania since I was a kid. I spent about a decade in Northeast PA (or NEPA for short), six years in Philadelphia, and I'm now in Pittsburgh. I'm a Northeasterner at heart - please ask me about how much I love Wawa. <br>

                    <br> Please feel free to check out my <a href="pdfs\Brandon_Joel_Gonzalez_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a> for an extensive description of my academic work. In the sections below, I'll talk about some exciting experiences that I've had in teaching, research interests, course projects, and some personal hobbies. I hope you enjoy learning a bit about myself!</p>

                    <p> As a graduate student, I've become very interested in electronics engineering. For my doctoral program at CMU, I am advised by <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/carley-rick.html">Professor Rick Carley</a> of the ECE Department, where I am focusing on integrated systems design and device fabrication. I will link future projects and publications related to my doctoral research as they come in the years ahead! </p>

                    <p> I was awarded the GEM Fellowship as part of the 2023 cohort, and I had the opportunity to work as an intern at MIT Lincoln Lab in Summer 2023. I worked on RF systems design for communication systems. While I may not be able to share the experimental results from my internship, I am grateful to have had the chance to learn from experts in the field at the lab. </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Teaching</h2>
                    <p>Teaching is a passion of mine that I've always had. I began as a tutor back in my high school days for a few different subjects, which I then carried into my time at UPenn. In my first three undergraduate years, I worked as a peer tutor for various subjects, from calculus to computer systems to electromagnetism. But it wasn't until my fourth undergraduate year that I got the opportunity to become a teaching assistant for an introductory computer systems course. </p>

                    <p>Since then, I've had the great fortune to TA a number of courses in electrical engineering and computer science at UPenn. I've held office hours + recitations + lab sessions + lectures, developed course labs + projects + curricula, mentored students on projects, and more. Further below is a list of those courses, with semesters as head TA denoted with * and semesters online denoted with ^. </p>

                    <p>Additionally, I'm honored to have been inducted into the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/ta-information/ta-hall-of-fame/">CIS TA Hall of Fame</a> in Spring 2020. I aspire to continue teaching in the future, hopefully taking up a lecturing position as a professor after I complete my PhD. I've particularly enjoyed helping run lab courses - guiding students in learning how to do lab work themselves is an engaging, rewarding experience. Here's to many more years in teaching! </p>

                    <p>I've had the great opportunity to take a number of fascinating courses in my time at UPenn and CMU including Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, IC Design, and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some of my favorite projects included designing: a pipelined superscalar CPU in Verilog; a 16-bit ripple-carry adder, an SRAM array, a transimpedance amplifier, a two-stage op-amp, and an RF transceiver (all at the MOSFET-level using SPICE and Cadence); and an AM radio receiver in the lab using discrete electronic components.</p>
                    
                    <p>Though I had varying levels of success in these projects, I'm glad to have learned lots from them. Below, I discuss a few more fun projects in more detail...</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">18-745: Rapid Prototyping of Computer Systems</div>
                            <p> This was part of a larger course project in which the entire class focused on developing ways to enhance public transportation in Pittsburgh. This centered on three main areas: developing personal devices to collect data during transit, using infrastructure sensing to detect problems around the city, and building kiosks to relay information to citizens. There were several teams focused on a number of topics: Human-Computer Interaction, Hardware, Software, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Cloud/Databases. </p>

                            <p> My team focused on Hardware development for Infrastructure Sensing. We explored a number of sensors that could help us collect information about the state of transportation in the city. Ultimately, we focused on image data to detect obstacles on the road and accelerometer data to detect potholes and other bumps while driving; these sensors were interfaced with Raspberry Pi devices. We then set up a wireless network to stream data packets to a cloud database for offline analysis, resulting in these issues around the city being flagged on a map. </p>
                            
                            <p> This project was a unique experience, collaborating closely with several teams across the span of the entire semester.

Based on a mission file provided at the start of the test trial, the robot visited the appropriate stations and set the valves and breakers to specific positions. </p>
                            
                            <p> The robot required a wide combination of skills from each team member, from embedded systems and electronics design to mechanical prototyping and robot kinematics. We used several different processors, including Arduino boards and a Jetson Nano, as well as a number of actuators such as DC motors with encoder feedback, stepper motors, and linear actuators. A RealSense D435i camera provided our robot with perception. The project exercised knowledge of both hardware and software systems design. </p>
                            
                             <p> This project was a semester's worth of effort and cooperation between everyone on our team, and we're quite proud of our first place finish in the class competition! Here is my team's <a href="https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/drunken-sailors/">website</a>, which contains a complete description of our robot's design in addition to video demos. </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">ROBO597: Master's Thesis</div>
                            <p>For my master's thesis at UPenn, I worked under the guidance of Professor Camillo Jose Taylor (of <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP</a> at UPenn) and Dr. Madhu Annapragada along with two companies at <a href="https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/">Pennovation</a> - <a href="https://www.getinstahub.com/">Instahub</a> and <a href="http://www.automationresearchgroup.com/">Automation Research Group</a> (the latter of which Dr. Annapragada owns). </p>

                            <p> We sought to develop a hybrid sensor system for human occupancy detection. We examined a wide variety of sensors - from PIR to thermopile array to mm-wave - and attempted to combine them in order to develop an efficient, novel device that accurately counts human occupants. The project was an exciting combination of embedded systems and signal processing research; even if I did not achieve all of my goals, I still learned a huge amount about a range of topics across disciplines. <p>

                            <p>I worked in a team of four to develop a robot that could harvest tea leaves. This project was a combination of computer vision and mechatronics. Our robot used an Intel RealSense depth camera to identify a leaf using image processing and then direct a custom-manufactured arm to move to extract the leaf. </p>

                            <p> We were able to get a basic proof-of-concept model working by the end of the year, which could hopefully be built upon in the future. Here is my team's <a href="pdfs\Senior_Design_Final_Report.pdf">final report</a> along with our <a href="https://devpost.com/software/teabot-e5dwsc">Devpost submission</a> which has a video summary. </p>

                            <p>I worked in a team of four to develop a robot that could participate in a team tower defense game along with several other robots. Our team built the robot from scratch, laser-cutting the pieces from CAD models to assemble, and was fitted with a swinging arm to attack other robots. The robot navigated using 4-wheel differential drive and was powered by AA/9V/LiPo batteries. We wrote C++ code on ESP32 and ATmega32 boards, directing the robot using a custom remote controller. </p>

                            <p> This was a very challenging but incredibly fun project that took over a month of planning and effort! Here is my team's <a href="pdfs\BattleBot_Report.pdf">final report</a> along with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypR6t6pXjTg">video demo</a> of our robot on the field. </p>

                    <p> I've come to love electrical and computer engineering and I'm excited to dedicate myself to this field, both as a teacher and a researcher, but I wasn't always fixated on engineering. In fact, when I first started college, I was set on becoming a history major! It wasn't until I took my first few courses in STEM that I began to fall in love with engineering, as difficult as it can be. I made the transfer at the end of my second year and never looked back - but I still care lots about the humanities and social sciences. </p>

                    <p> Besides academics, I'm also an avid gamer; I've grown up playing video games my entire life. I'm a big fan of retro games from my childhood, as well as more modern PC games. I am a longtime enjoyer of DDR (DanceDanceRevolution), and I love to practice and improve when I can! Additionally, I'm a lover of music, of all varieties - rock, rap, electronic, and more. Some of my favorite artists include TOOL and Aesop Rock, among many others. I also love to play the bass guitar and learn riffs from my favorite songs in my spare time. </p>
