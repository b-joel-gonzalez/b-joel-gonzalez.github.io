                    <p>Teaching is a passion of mine that I've always had. I began as a tutor back in my high school days for a few different subjects, which I then carried into my time at UPenn. In my first three undergraduate years, I worked as a peer tutor for various subjects, from calculus to computer systems to electromagnetism. But it wasn't until my fourth undergraduate year that I got the opportunity to become a teaching assistant for an introductory computer systems course. </p>

                    <p>Since then, I've had the great fortune to TA a number of courses in electrical engineering and computer science at UPenn. I've held office hours + recitations + lab sessions + lectures, developed course labs + projects + curricula, mentored students on projects, and more. Here's a list of those courses - semesters as head TA denoted with *, semesters online denoted with ^: </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">CIS240/CIT593</div>
                            <p>An introductory course on computer systems. Students learn the bottom-up fundamentals of modern computers, from CMOS transistor circuits to digital logic basics. Once they understand how datapaths and ISAs work, they then switch to a top-down view and work in assembly and C, building their understanding of an operating system. </p>

                            <p> Course projects include writing a basic user/OS program in LC-4 assembly (an educational programming language similar to LC-3) and writing a disassembler and a compiler in C. </p>

                            CIS240 (Fall/Spring) is the undergraduate version while <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit593/">CIT593 (Summer)</a> is the graduate version, but they shared the same course material. </p>

                            <p>A project course on computer architecture. This course builds upon the earlier concepts introduced in CIS240/CIT593. Students learn more about how modern processors are optimized for speed and efficiency. Methods discussed include pipelining, superscalar design, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, caching, multicore design, and more. </p>

                            <p> Throughout the course, students use Verilog to program digital logic building blocks such as a ripple-carry adder, a carrylook-ahead adder, a divider, and an ALU. They then take these building blocks to build up an LC-4 CPU, enhanced with pipelining and superscalar designs. Students simulate their designs using Vivado and upload their code to a ZedBoard FPGA. </p>

                            <p>An introduction to hardware/software lab work using the Arduino platform - the course is designed for non-engineers who don't have much programming or circuit experience. Students learned the basics of programming and physics to build their own circuit projects using Arduino. </p>

                            <p> Students used the standard Arduino Uno model for the labs. Labs included turning on LEDs with pushbuttons, building a mini-thermostat, and using WiFi for IoT communication. They wrote their code in C and were encouraged to use external libraries as needed for their final project. </p>

                    <p>As a graduate student, I've become very interested in hardware development, particularly within electronics engineering. I want to work to develop more efficient electronics, which push the boundaries of today's computational power. I'm interested in working across all disciplines of electronics, from digital to analog to power, and utilizing a multitude of technologies, from mm-wave to RF and more. </p>

                    <p> To this end, I've chosen to focus on an electronics project for my master's thesis; I seek to develop a hybrid sensor system for occupancy detection. I'm looking into a wide variety of sensors - from mm-wave to PIR to image - to see how I might combine them in order to develop an efficient, novel device that accurately detects a human occupant. Ultimately, I aim to manufacture a PCB prototype as a proof-of-concept. </p>

                    <p>For my master's thesis, I'm working under the guidance of Dr. Camillo Jose Taylor (of <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP</a> at UPenn) and Dr. Madhu Annapragada along with two companies at <a href="https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/">Pennovation</a> - <a href="https://www.getinstahub.com/">Instahub</a> and <a href="http://www.automationresearchgroup.com/">Automation Research Group</a> (the latter of which Dr. Annapragada owns). I will link my thesis here once it's completed in May 2021! Once I finish my master's degree, I hope to ultimately pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in order to conduct novel research and to help expand the field of electronics. </p>

                            <p>I worked in a team of four to develop a robot that could harvest tea leaves. This project was a combination of computer vision and mechatronics. Our robot used an Intel RealSense depth camera to identify a leaf using image processing and then direct a custom-manufactured arm to move to extract the leaf. </p>

                            <p> We were able to get a basic proof-of-concept model working by the end of the year, which could hopefully be built upon in the future.

Our team built the robot from scratch, laser-cutting the pieces from CAD models to assemble, and was fitted with a swinging arm to attack other robots. The robot navigated using 4-wheel differential drive and was powered by AA/9V/LiPo batteries. We wrote C++ code on ESP32 and ATmega32 boards, directing the robot using a custom remote controller. </p>

                            <p> This was a very challenging but incredibly fun project that took over a month of planning and effort!

A precursor to the BattleBot from the same course above, this car was much simpler in that it didn't have any offensive/defensive capabilities; it was only intended to partake in a race against other cars. We used similar tools as the BattleBot to build this mini-racecar. </p>

                            <p> Our car struggled to move on some surfaces due to friction resulting from the mechanical design, but it was a great engineering design task to prepare for the final project. Here is my team's <a href="pdfs\RC_Racecar_Report.pdf">final report</a>. </p>

                            <p>I worked in a team of two to develop a system to filter and separate out treble and bass from an audio signal, using the filtered outputs to light up respective LED strips. We implemented the high-pass/low-pass filtering in hardware, fed the filtered inputs into an Arduino to detect whether there was treble or bass, and then used the Arduino to drive the appropriate BJT to light up the LEDs. </p>

                            <p> This was a project that we did for extra credit on top of the regular labs at the end of the course, and was a creative finish to a wonderful course. Here is my team's <a href="pdfs\Digital_Audio_Filter_Report.pdf">final report</a>. </p>

                            <p>I worked in a team of two to develop a basic AM radio receiver, which could be tuned to listen in on any local AM radio station. There were several steps in building the system, from amplifying to bandpass filtering to half-wave rectification. This was one of the major labs in the course that served to tie together several concepts from earlier labs. </p>

                            <p> It was very satisfying to put all the pieces together - I'll never forget when we were actually able to pick up and play a local radio station on our speaker, using something we built by hand! Unfortunately, I'm unable to publically share my report for this project in the interest of future students taking the course.

                            <p>I worked in a team of two to develop an SRAM array at the MOSFET-level. The SRAM array was able to hold 16 4-bit data elements and worked as a FIFO queue. The FIFO queue could take in an enqueue or dequeue signal which would either insert a new 4-bit data element (if there was space) into the array or read out the next 4-bit data element in the array (if it was present) respectively. We had to design the SRAM system in two parts: the actual array with 16x4 SRAM cells (6 MOSFETs each), and the control logic that took in a clock signal, enqueue signal, and dequeue signal and directed the system as needed. </p>

                            <p> A very challenging but engaging project in digital design, built using Electric and tested using Ngspice.

                            <p>I developed an 8-bit ripple-carry adder (RCA) at the MOSFET-level. I built the RCA from the bottom-up, cascading several full-adders together to form an 8-bit adder. The goal of the project was to optimize for delay - we were allowed to toggle several parameters in order to achieve this metric. This included gate structure, gate type, MOSFET sizes, logic discipline, and supply voltage. </p>

                            <p> Using Electric and Ngspice, this project tied together various concepts about optimization in digital design that we discussed in the course.

                            <p>I worked in a team of two to develop a 5-stage pipeline + 2-way superscalar processor using Verilog. We started from the very basic building blocks, writing a half-adder, then a full-adder, then a ripple-carry adder. We then improved upon this design to build a carry-lookahead adder, which we integrated into an Arithmetic Logic Unit (alongside a custom divider). Once we had the ALU coded, we moved onto the entire LC-4 datapath, which we enhanced with pipelining and superscalar design. </p>

                            <p> It was very satisfying to build up the entire datapath from basic logic gates, and a valuable experience to work with Verilog and FPGAs.

                    <p> I've come to love electrical and computer engineering and I'm excited to dedicate myself to this field, both as a teacher and a researcher, but I wasn't always fixated on engineering. In fact, when I first came to UPenn back in 2015, I was entirely set on becoming a history major! It wasn't until I took my first few courses in mathematics, physics, and computer science that I began to fall in love with engineering, brutal as it could be. I made the transfer at the end of my second year and never looked back. But I still really enjoy learning and discussing history and related fields as a hobby. </p>

                    <p> Besides academics, I'm also an avid gamer; I've grown up playing video games my entire life. I'm a particularly big fan of older games from my childhood on the Nintendo Gameboy, Nintendo Gamecube, and Playstation 2, as well as more modern games available on PC. Perhaps my biggest passion in video gaming is for "Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube", or just "Melee" for short - a game from 2001 that still has a vibrant and active competitive scene to this very day. I try to be engaged in the Melee community at UPenn when I have some time! </p>
