                    <br> I completed my B.S.E. in Computer Science in Fall 2019 and I expect to complete my M.S.E. in Robotics in Spring 2021, both at UPenn. I hope to further my studies of electrical engineering in 2021, via a doctorate and/or industry. <br>

                    <br> Please feel free to check out my <a href="pdfs\Brandon_Joel_Gonzalez_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a> for an extensive description of my academic and professional work. In the sections below, I'll talk about some exciting experiences that I've had in teaching, research interests, and course projects, as well as some personal hobbies. I hope you enjoy learning a bit about myself!</p>

                    <p>Teaching is a passion of mine that I've always had. I began as a tutor back in my high school days for a few different subjects, which I then carried onto my time at UPenn. In my first three undergraduate years, I worked as a peer tutor for various subjects, from calculus to programming languages to electromagnetism. </p>

                    <p>But it wasn't until my fourth undergraduate year that I got the opportunity to become a teaching assistant for an introductory computer systems course. Since then, I've had the great fortune to help teach a number of courses in electrical engineering and computer science at UPenn. Here's a list of those courses: </p>

                    <p>I hope to continue to teach in the future, hopefully taking up a lecturing position at some point. I've particularly enjoyed helping run lab courses - developing a lab session and helping students learn to do the work themselves is an amazing and rewarding experience. Here's to many more years in teaching! </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Research</h2>
                    <p>As a graduate student, I've become very interested in hardware development, particularly within electronics engineering. I want to work to develop more efficient electronics, which push the boundaries of today's computational power. I'm interested in working across all disciplines of electronics, from digital to analog to power, and utilizing a multitude of technologies, from mm-wave to RF and more. </p>

                    <p> To this end, I've chosen to focus on an electronics project for my master's thesis; I seek to develop a hybrid sensor device for occupancy detection. I'm looking into a wide variety of sensors - from mm-wave to PIR to image - to see how I might combine them in order to develop an efficient, novel device that accurately detects a human occupant. Ultimately, I aim to manufacture a PCB prototype as a proof-of-concept. </p>

                    <p>For my master's thesis, I'm working under the guidance of Dr. Camillo Jose Taylor (of <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP</a> at UPenn) and Dr. Madhu Annapragada along with two companies at <a href="https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/">Pennovation</a> - <a href="https://www.getinstahub.com/">Instahub</a> and <a href="http://www.automationresearchgroup.com/">Automation Research Group</a> (the latter of which Dr. Annapragada owns). I will link my thesis here once it's completed in May 2021! Once I finish my master's degree, I hope to eventually pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in order to conduct novel research and to help expand the field of electronics. </p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
                    <p> I've come to love electrical and computer engineering and I look forward to dedicating myself to this field, both as a teacher and a researcher - but I wasn't always fixated on engineering. In fact, when I first came to UPenn back in 2015, I was entirely set on becoming a history major! It wasn't until I took my first few courses in mathematics, physics, and computer science that I began to fall in love with engineering, brutal as it could be. I made the transfer at the end of my second year and never looked back. But I still really enjoy learning and discussing history and related fields as a hobby. </p>

                    <p> Besides academics, I'm also an avid gamer; I've grown up playing video games my entire life. I'm a particularly big fan of older games from my childhood on the Nintendo Gameboy, Nintendo Gamecube, and Playstation 2, as well as more modern games available on PC. Perhaps my biggest passion in video gaming is for "Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube", or just "Melee" for short - a game from 2001 that still has a vibrant and active competitive scene to this very day. I try to be engaged in the Melee community at UPenn when I have some time! </p>
