                    <p>Teaching is a passion of mine that I've always had. I began as a tutor back in my high school days for a few different subjects, which I then carried into my time at UPenn. In my first three undergraduate years, I worked as a peer tutor for various subjects, from calculus to computer systems to electromagnetism. But it wasn't until my fourth undergraduate year that I got the opportunity to become a teaching assistant for an introductory computer systems course. </p>

                    <p>Since then, I've had the great fortune to TA a number of courses in electrical engineering and computer science at UPenn. I've held office hours + recitations + lab sessions + lectures, developed course labs + projects + curricula, mentored students on projects, and more. Here's a list of those courses - semesters as head TA denoted with *, semesters online denoted with ^: </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">CIS240/CIT593</div>
                            <p>An introductory course on computer systems. Students learn the bottom-up fundamentals of modern computers, from CMOS transistor circuits to digital logic basics. Once they understand how the datapath and ISAs work, they then switch to a top-down view and work in assembly and C, building their understanding of an operating system. </p>

                            <p> Course projects include writing a basic user/OS program in LC-4 assembly (an educational programming language similar to LC-3) and writing a disassembler and a compiler in C. </p>

                            CIS240 (Fall/Spring) is the undergraduate version while <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit593/">CIT593 (Summer)</a> is the graduate version, but they shared the same course material. </p>

                            <p>A project course on operating systems. This course builds upon the latter concepts introduced in CIS240/CIT593. Students learn about the basics of an operating system, including process management, system calls, memory management, scheduling algorithms, file systems, and more. </p>

                            <p> Students mainly work with Unix-like systems and program in C. Course projects include writing a user shell and building "PennOS", a Unix-like operating system with a priority scheduler and flat filesystem. </p>

                            <p> <a href="https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/about/teaching/cis380/">CIS380 (Fall)</a> is the undergraduate version while <a href="https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/about/teaching/cis548-sp20/">CIS548 (Spring)</a> and CIT595 (Summer) are the graduate versions, the latter belonging to the <a href="https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/">MCIT program</a>. CIS548 had an additional project on memory management while CIT595 cut out the PennOS project and instead had a project on networked systems. </p>

                            <p>A project course on computer architecture. This course builds upon the earlier concepts introduced in CIS240/CIT593. Students learn more about how modern processors are optimized for speed and efficiency. Methods discussed include pipelining, superscalar design, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, caching, multicore design, and more. </p>

                            <p> Throughout the course, students use Verilog to program digital logic building blocks such as a ripple-carry adder, a carrylook-ahead adder, a divider, and an ALU. They then take these building blocks to build up an LC-4 CPU, enhanced with pipelining and superscalar designs. Students simulate their designs using Vivado and upload their code to a Xilinx FPGA board. </p>

                    <p>As a graduate student, I've become very interested in hardware development, particularly within electronics engineering. I want to work to develop more efficient electronics, which push the boundaries of today's computational power. I'm interested in working across all disciplines of electronics, from digital to analog to power, and utilizing a multitude of technologies, from mm-wave to RF and more. </p>

                    <p> To this end, I've chosen to focus on an electronics project for my master's thesis; I seek to develop a hybrid sensor system for occupancy detection. I'm looking into a wide variety of sensors - from mm-wave to PIR to image - to see how I might combine them in order to develop an efficient, novel device that accurately detects a human occupant. Ultimately, I aim to manufacture a PCB prototype as a proof-of-concept. </p>

                    <p>For my master's thesis, I'm working under the guidance of Dr. Camillo Jose Taylor (of <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP</a> at UPenn) and Dr. Madhu Annapragada along with two companies at <a href="https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/">Pennovation</a> - <a href="https://www.getinstahub.com/">Instahub</a> and <a href="http://www.automationresearchgroup.com/">Automation Research Group</a> (the latter of which Dr. Annapragada owns). I will link my thesis here once it's completed in May 2021! Once I finish my master's degree, I hope to ultimately pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in order to conduct novel research and to help expand the field of electronics. </p>

                    <p> I've come to love electrical and computer engineering and I'm excited to dedicate myself to this field, both as a teacher and a researcher, but I wasn't always fixated on engineering. In fact, when I first came to UPenn back in 2015, I was entirely set on becoming a history major! It wasn't until I took my first few courses in mathematics, physics, and computer science that I began to fall in love with engineering, brutal as it could be. I made the transfer at the end of my second year and never looked back. But I still really enjoy learning and discussing history and related fields as a hobby. </p>

                    <p> Besides academics, I'm also an avid gamer; I've grown up playing video games my entire life. I'm a particularly big fan of older games from my childhood on the Nintendo Gameboy, Nintendo Gamecube, and Playstation 2, as well as more modern games available on PC. Perhaps my biggest passion in video gaming is for "Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube", or just "Melee" for short - a game from 2001 that still has a vibrant and active competitive scene to this very day. I try to be engaged in the Melee community at UPenn when I have some time! </p>
