                    <p class="lead mb-5">Welcome to my site! My name is Joel* - I'm an electronics engineer and a giant geek. I'm passionate about all things ECE, and I love to teach and learn. <br>

                    <br> I'm a doctoral student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (beginning 2021). I attended the University of Pennsylvania for my undergraduate education, where I studied Computer Science and Robotics (Class of 2020). I love thinking about electronics, from systems-level design down to device fabrication and everything in-between. <br>
                        
                    <br> I was born in New York City, but I have lived in Pennsylvania since I was a kid. I spent about a decade in Northeast PA (or NEPA for short), six years in Philadelphia, and I'm now in Pittsburgh. I'm a Northeasterner at heart - please ask me about how much I love Wawa. <br>

                    <br> Please feel free to check out my <a href="pdfs\Brandon_Joel_Gonzalez_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a> for an extensive description of my academic work. In the sections below, I'll talk about some exciting experiences that I've had in teaching, research interests, and some personal hobbies. I hope you enjoy learning a bit about myself!</p>
                    
                    <br> *My first name is Brandon, but I prefer to go by my middle name, Joel. You can pronounce it as one syllable ("Jol") or two ("Jo-el") - I like both. :)</p>

                    <p> As a graduate student, I've focused on electronics engineering and novel device research. For my doctoral program at CMU, I am advised by <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/carley-rick.html">Professor Rick Carley</a> of the ECE Department, where I am focusing on integrated systems design and device fabrication.</p>
                        
                    <p> I joined CMU's Hacker Fab at its inception in January 2023. Our lab aims to create low cost, open-source hardware and software to fabricate integrated circuits, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing of chips. Feel free to check out <a href="https://hackerfab.ece.cmu.edu/">our website</a> for more information on our work!</p>

                    <p> I was awarded the GEM Fellowship as part of the 2023 cohort, and I had the opportunity to work as an intern at MIT Lincoln Lab in Summer 2023. I worked on RF systems design for communication systems. While I may not be able to share the experimental results from my internship, I am grateful to have had the chance to learn from experts in the field at the lab.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Teaching</h2>
                    <p>Teaching is a passion of mine that I've always had. I began as a tutor back in my high school days for a few different subjects, which I then carried into my time at UPenn. In my first three undergraduate years, I worked as a peer tutor for various subjects, from calculus to computer systems to electromagnetism. But it wasn't until my fourth undergraduate year that I got the opportunity to become a teaching assistant for an introductory computer systems course. </p>

                    <p>Since then, I've had the great fortune to TA a number of courses in electrical engineering and computer science at UPenn. I've held office hours + recitations + lab sessions + lectures, developed course labs + projects + curricula, mentored students on projects, and more. Further below is a list of those courses, with semesters as head TA denoted with * and semesters online denoted with ^. </p>

                    <p>Additionally, I'm honored to have been inducted into the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/ta-information/ta-hall-of-fame/">CIS TA Hall of Fame</a> in Spring 2020. I aspire to continue teaching in the future, hopefully taking up a lecturing position as a professor after I complete my PhD. I've particularly enjoyed helping run lab courses - guiding students in learning how to do lab work themselves is an engaging, rewarding experience. Here's to many more years in teaching! </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">CIS240/CIT593</div>
                            <p>An introductory course on computer systems. Students learn the bottom-up fundamentals of modern computers, from CMOS transistor circuits to digital logic basics. Once they understand how datapaths and ISAs work, they switch to a top-down view and work in assembly and C to build their understanding of an operating system. </p>

                            <p> Course projects include writing a basic user/OS program in LC-4 assembly (an educational programming language similar to LC-3) and writing a disassembler and a compiler in C. </p>

                            CIS240 (Fall/Spring) is the undergraduate version while <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit593/">CIT593 (Summer)</a> is the graduate version, but they shared the same course material. </p>

                            <p>A project course on operating systems. This course builds upon the latter concepts introduced in CIS240/CIT593. Students learn about the basics of an operating system, including process management, system calls, memory management, scheduling algorithms, file systems, and more. </p>

                            <p> Students mainly work with Unix-like systems and program in C. Course projects include writing a user shell and building "PennOS", a Unix-like operating system with a priority scheduler and flat filesystem. </p>

                            <p>A project course on computer architecture. This course builds upon the earlier concepts introduced in CIS240/CIT593. Students learn more about how modern processors are optimized for speed and efficiency. Methods discussed include pipelining, superscalar design, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, caching, multicore design, and more. </p>

                            <p> Throughout the course, students use Verilog to program digital logic building blocks such as a ripple-carry adder, a carrylook-ahead adder, a divider, and an ALU. They then take these building blocks to build up an LC-4 CPU, enhanced with pipelining and superscalar designs. Students simulate their designs using Vivado and upload their code to a ZedBoard FPGA. </p>

The course is designed for non-engineers who don't have much programming or circuit experience. Students learn the basics of programming and physics to build their own circuit projects using Arduino. </p>

                            <p> Students use the standard Arduino Uno model for the labs. Labs include turning on LEDs with pushbuttons, building a mini-thermostat, and using WiFi for IoT communication. They write their code in C and are encouraged to use external libraries as needed for their final project. </p>

The course starts from the hardware-level and covers power management and circuitry for an embedded system. It moves to low-level programming, understanding how to write C to control the various pins and registers on an embedded platform. It finishes with a conceptual, software-level tour of real-time operating systems before students build a final project of their choosing. </p>

                            <p> Students write their code in C on the Arduino Uno, using the standard C + AVR + FreeRTOS libraries for the labs and final project. For the final project, they are allowed to use other microcontrollers if preferred. </p>

                    <p> I've come to love electrical and computer engineering and I'm excited to dedicate myself to this field, both as a teacher and a researcher, but I wasn't always fixated on engineering. In fact, when I first started college, I was set on becoming a history major! It wasn't until I took my first few courses in STEM that I began to fall in love with engineering, as difficult as it can be. I made the transfer at the end of my second year and never looked back - but I still care lots about the humanities and social sciences. </p>

                    <p> Besides academics, I'm also an avid gamer; I've grown up playing video games my entire life. I'm a big fan of retro games from my childhood, as well as more modern PC games. I am a longtime enjoyer of DDR (DanceDanceRevolution), and I love to practice and improve when I can! Additionally, I'm a lover of music, of all varieties - rock and metal, electronic, and much more. Some of my favorite artists include TOOL and Aesop Rock, among many others. I also love to play the bass guitar and learn riffs from my favorite songs in my spare time. </p>
