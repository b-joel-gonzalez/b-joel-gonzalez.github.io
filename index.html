                    <br> I completed my B.S.E. in Computer Science in Fall 2019 and I expect to complete my M.S.E. in Robotics in Spring 2021, both at UPenn. I hope to further my studies of electrical engineering in 2021, via a doctorate and/or industry. <br>

                    <br> Please feel free to check out my <a href="pdfs\Brandon_Joel_Gonzalez_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a> for an extensive description of my academic and professional work. In the sections below, I'll talk about some exciting experiences that I've had in teaching, research interests, and course projects, as well as some personal hobbies. I hope you enjoy learning a bit about myself!</p>

                    <p>Teaching is a passion of mine that I've always had. I began as a tutor back in my high school days for a few different subjects, which I then carried onto my time at UPenn. In my first three undergraduate years, I worked as a peer tutor for various subjects, from calculus to programming languages to electromagnetism. </p>

                    <p>But it wasn't until my fourth undergraduate year that I got the opportunity to become a teaching assistant for an introductory computer systems course. Since then, I've had the great fortune to help teach a number of courses in electrical engineering and computer science at UPenn. Here's a list of those courses: </p>

                    <p>I hope to continue to teach in the future, hopefully taking up a lecturing position at some point. I've particularly enjoyed helping run lab courses - developing a lab and helping students do the work themselves and learn is an awesome experience. Here's to many more years in teaching! </p>

                    <p>I spent a significant part of my undergraduate years narrowing down my research interests, working in predominantly software engineering positions. I worked in three labs at UPenn during those years - one in Physics, one in Computer Graphics, and one in Robotics. They were valuable experiences that helped me learn about what topics I enjoyed and how to become a better researcher - check out my CV if you'd like to learn about what I did in each lab. </p>

                    <p>As a graduate student, however, I've become much more interested in hardware work, particularly involving electronics. To this end, I've chosen to focus on an electronics project for my master's thesis this year, to be completed in May 2021. For this project, I am working with two companies at Pennovation (Instahub and Automation Research Group) in order to develop a hybrid sensor device for occupancy detection. Our goal for this project is to look into a variety of sensors - from mm-wave to PIR to image - and combine them in order to develop an efficient device that accurately detects a human occupant. I will link my thesis here once it's completed! </p>

                    <p>Through this work, I've found a deep interest in electronics engineering. I want to work to develop more efficient electronics, which push the boundaries of today's computational power. I'm interested in working across all disciplines of electronics, from digital to analog to power, and utilizing a multitude of technologies, from mm-wave to RF and more. I hope to eventually pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in order to conduct novel research and to help expand the field. </p>

                    <p> I've come to love electrical and computer engineering and I look forward to dedicating myself to this field, both as a teacher and a researcher - but I wasn't always fixated on engineering. In fact, when I first came to UPenn back in 2015, I was entirely set on becoming a history major! It wasn't until I took my first few courses in mathematics, physics, and computer science that I began to fall in love with engineering, brutal as it could be. I made the transfer at the end of my second year and never looked back. But I still really enjoy learning and discussing history and related fields as a hobby. </p>

                    <p> Besides academics, I'm also an avid gamer; I've grown up playing video games my entire life. I'm a particularly big fan of older games from my childhood on the Nintendo Gameboy, Nintendo Gamecube, and Playstation 2, as well as more modern games available on PC. Perhaps my biggest passion in video gaming is for "Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube", or just "Melee" for short - a game from 2001 that still has a vibrant and active competitive scene to this very day. I try to be engaged in the Melee community at UPenn when I have some time! </p>
